## Read data

## Display distribution of birth month

```{r}

                 "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

# Convert the birth_month column in nhl_data to factor with month names as labels
nhl_data$birth_month <- factor(nhl_data$birth_month, levels = 1:12, labels = month_names)

# Now, continue with the rest of your code
# Step 2: Calculate the percentage of players born in each month
birth_month_counts <- table(nhl_data$birth_month) 
# Count the occurrences of each birth month
total_players <- nrow(nhl_data)  # Total number of players

percentages <- (birth_month_counts / total_players) * 100  # Calculate percentages

# Create a data frame with the calculated percentages

## This graph show all the information of players throughout dozens of seasons so let's dive deeper into each season to make sure that nothing interesting is being missed.


## Merging data so it will include only useful columns.

  # Select and rename columns from the merged dataset
